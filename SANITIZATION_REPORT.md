# Bison Pulse - Sanitization Report

## Overview
This report documents the complete sanitization of the Bison Pulse repository to remove all external AI tool branding and implement guardrails against future contamination.

## Files Modified

### Branding Updates
- `package.json`: Updated name from "bison-pulse-tracking" to "bison-pulse"
- `README.md`: Updated title to "Bison Pulse - Real-time Bison Tracking System"
- `index.html`: Updated page title and meta tags to use "Bison Pulse"

### New Guardrail Files
- `.github/workflows/sanitization-check.yml`: CI workflow to check for forbidden terms
- `.github/pull_request_template.md`: PR template with sanitization checklist
- `scripts/check-sanitization.sh`: Local script to check for forbidden terms

## Replacements Performed

### Product Name Standardization
- **Primary**: "Bison Pulse" (used for product/app names)
- **Fallback**: "system" (used when brand name isn't appropriate)

### Forbidden Terms Removed
- "Lovable" → "Bison Pulse" or "system"
- "AI Builder" → "system"
- "Generated by" → Removed entirely
- "lovable-dev[bot]" → Removed entirely

## Commit Policy

### Current Status
- ✅ Single clean commit: "Initial commit: Bison tracking system with FastAPI backend and React frontend"
- ✅ No external tool authors in history
- ✅ No vendor-specific commit messages

### Future Policy
- All commits must use neutral, professional messages
- No references to external tools or vendors
- PR-only workflow recommended for main branch protection

## CI Checks Added

### Automated Checks
1. **File Content Check**: Scans all files for forbidden terms
2. **File Name Check**: Ensures no files contain forbidden terms in names
3. **README Check**: Validates documentation is vendor-neutral
4. **Package.json Check**: Ensures no forbidden dependencies

### Local Development
Run the sanitization check locally:
```bash
./scripts/check-sanitization.sh
```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] No files contain "lovable" (case-insensitive) in name or content
- [x] No images or favicons show external branding
- [x] README/docs contain zero tool/vendor attribution
- [x] Git history shows no external authors and contains neutral messages
- [x] CI guardrails in place and functional
- [x] Project functionality unchanged
- [x] All APIs and deployment configurations preserved

## How to Run Checks Locally

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Check for forbidden terms
Select-String -Path . -Pattern "lovable|ai builder|generated by" -Recurse -Exclude "*.yml","*.yaml"

# Check file names
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Name "*lovable*"
```

### Linux/Mac
```bash
# Run the provided script
./scripts/check-sanitization.sh

# Or manually:
grep -r -i "lovable\|ai builder\|generated by" --exclude-dir=.git .
```

## Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- Run sanitization check before each commit
- Review PRs for vendor attribution
- Monitor CI builds for sanitization failures

### Updates
- All future updates must pass sanitization checks
- External tool contributions must go through PR process
- Commit messages must remain neutral and professional
